# Robot Update Timber Sections

This application is meant to be bundled into a single file executable that forms part of the backend for the [Timber Structural Design Software](https://github.com/SeifFahmy/timber-structural-design).

It accepts a JSON that represents the structural section sizes timber members in the Robot model should be assigned, then connects to Robot using its API to update the section sizes.
